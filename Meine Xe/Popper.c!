-- Pop-up menu xfcn. Text is return delimited list of menu items (standard meta-characters are accepted as well) or a MENU resource id number. xy is the topleft of the menu in the window's local coordinates. curItem is the currently selected item in the list if any (this item will be hilited when the menu pops up). An id number of 17003 is hard-wired in this XFCN, a better method would be to test for an unused id number on the fly and use that number instead.

function Popper text,xy,curItem
  if text is empty or xy is empty then return empty
  if curItem is empty then put 0 into curItem
  put 17003 into myId
  setPt aPoint, item 1 of xy,item 2 of xy
  localtoglobal aPoint
  put newMenu(myId,"") into myHand
  if myHand is nil then return "!! Unable to create menu."
  AppendMenu myHand,text
  InsertMenu myHand,-1
  put  PopUpMenuSelect(myHand,hiWord(aPoint),loWord(aPoint),curItem) into myItem
  GetItem myHand,loWord(myItem),myItemText
  deleteMenu myId
