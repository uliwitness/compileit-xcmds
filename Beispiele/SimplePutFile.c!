-- Display a standard SFPutFile dialog and return both the filename and vRefNum. Under System 7, if you set the loc of the putfile dialog to -1,-1, it will automatically be centered but on early systems you must supply the coordinates. You might want to improve on this XFCN so that it automatically centers itself under all systems.
